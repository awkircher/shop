# Shop
A multi-page website for a fictional Milwaukee-based coffee roaster. Handles routing using the `react-router-dom` package.

## Future Improvements
* Refactor ProductData and CartData to be regular React components, instead of modules.
* Refactor areas where information could be passed as props, instead of methods or attributes of modules.
* Interaction polish -- hover styles on buttons and navigation, transition animation on the cart modal.
